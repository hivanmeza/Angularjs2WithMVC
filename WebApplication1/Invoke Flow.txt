HomeController.IndexView

_Layout.cshtml

Index View populated via @RenderBody

AngularJS 2 app component ---> populate app/app.html

display 3 routes;

each route has different components, from the component.ts file, set the templateUrl, this templateUrl is the actually url to invoke the 
asp.net mvc controller and methods using MVC Route.

When routeConfig or routeDefition to define the route, 'selector' property is NOT important anymore, because the templat/template html will be put on the location where <router-outlet> locates.
